How it will end - it's up to you.\n\nEvery time after you enter the code (4 8 15 16 23 42) - a new piece of history will open and your score will increase. Periodically, you have to make difficult decisions, they will influence the further scenario. At any time, you can reset the current history to change the decision, but you'll have to start from the very beginning. If you do not enter the code on time, you risk destroying everything around and your score will be reset.\n\nYou will see the points of other players on the Best Players screen. After you go through the story to the end, you can сontinue to contend with them.\n\nIn the application there are two modes - HARDCORE for the most desperate, where you need to enter the code every 108 minutes, regardless of the time of day, and NORMAL, where you can set the time interval in which it will be convenient for you to enter the code and create your story.\n\nI will send notifications (do not forget to enable them) every time you need to save the world once again.\n\nSo, you woke up on the beach. Your story begins.\n\nSwipe right to continue.\n\nRegards,\nThe Creator.";

Under the ground led a curve, in some places without rails, an iron staircase. Below the light burned.\n\nGoing down, you were very surprised by the situation - the bunker turned out to be a cozy room, furnished very up to date for the 70s of the last century. There was a small kitchen, a huge bookshelf, a bar, a desk with an ancient computer, the same time a TV set on the wooden legs, a refrigerator and a door leading to the pantry. While you were looking around, you found just one video cassette with the inscription <Instruction for recruits>. Of course, it was immediately inserted incide a video player, after a short pause, a man in a robe appeared on the screen..>";

No land should not be within a radius of thousands of kilometers. The balloon was safe, there was enough fuel, the weather was more beautiful than ever. Then a bright flash and ... you are brought to the senses by that stranger. Complete nonsense.\n\nThinking about the above, you hear the noise from the outside. It looks like a crack, as if hundreds of trees are broken with a small interval. After listening, you notice another human cry, but it's not a cry of pain or a call for help, rather, it sounds like a warning. I can not make out the words. You remember that you did not close the hatch cover leading to the bunker and go back to the stairs. As you went up, it became quiet, so that every insect could be heard. You stick your head out from under the ground, and do not notice anything.\n\nCuriosity and instinct of self-preservation are struggling inside of you - can you close the lid from the inside and stay in the bunker?>";

For this it would be nice to collect all the available information in a heap and try to form a single picture of them.\n\nSo, a team of three enthusiasts, including you, left St. Petersburg (Russia) in a balloon two weeks ago (assuming that balloon crashed today). So your expedition to study the Earth's atmosphere began on Saturday, July 1, 2017. In the team with you there was a meteorologist Jack (USA) and old fellow Vasily from Belarus, a weatherman, which this world had not seen yet. Vasily took you into the team as a pilot, hands and his good friend. You landed once in the city of Linz (Austria) in order to replenish the reserves and leave on the earth the accumulated scientific materials. Since the balloon can not be controlled, except how to lift it or lower it, the final destination could be anything - where the wind is, there you are. So you flew over Paris and further to the west to the ocean. The expedition was extremely favorable, even too much - the wind was always constant and in one direction, it was strange, but you were very happy.>\n\nTo be continued..";

The guys told their meteorological jokes, you had a good time with them. There was one of the warm starry nights that there are over the Atlantic, there was not a cloud in the sky. The moon shone dimly, so there was hardly any glare on the water below, and it seemed that an abyss swung under the basket of the ball. That's what you thought when you were blinded by the flash. What happened next with the balloon - you do not know, you do not even know if you fell from him.\n\nOnly now did you realize that there is not a scratch on your body. But most of all, you were surprised that there were no asthma attacks from the very beginning of your stay on the island, although the bunker was quite dusty. At home in St. Petersburg, you would have long been suffocating without an inhaler.\n\nIt's strange, but somehow the idea of getting out of here as soon as possible or finding your team came not the first. Need to thoroughly inspect the bunker and pantry, and then try to get out from here as soon as I enter this damn code again.>";

A TV with one tape caused a smile: perhaps the absence of a movie is not the worst thing in cinema, if you recall modern Russian films.\n\nIn the pantry was all much more interesting. Provitant here was for several long lives: all kinds of canned food, products in sealed packages, sweets, cereals, even chips and beer in cans. <And here I can still sit, a day or two,> - you thought. There were also two built-in closets in the wall - one was full of clean clothes with DHARM logos, the other was lockable, but was open, it was a gun cabinet. One of the three stands under the pistols was empty, the rifle and shotgun were in their places, in the bottom boxes were boxes with cartridges.\n\nOh, it's not good for it's all ..>";

I decided to go back and warn you not to open this lid anymore and stick out, otherwise we all end. It is always there and is watching us! Barely I managed to hide in the cave, next time can not be lucky. Since we are still alive, that means you figured out the computer. Probably, you have many questions. Well, listen.\n\nThis is an unusual island. We arrived here within the expedition about a year ago, in 73rd. Only I survived.\n\nYou probably noticed that it's noisy here. Several times I saw smoke, it seemed to me that there were sparks inside it. If you hear a crack - run away as you can and hide. This smoke is completely unpredictable and very fast. It kills animals and knocks trees on the way. You will not believe, but I think it's alive.\n\n<To be continued..>";

Deciding to look around and at the same time find something edible, you went further into the jungle.\n\nThe island was a typical piece of land for these latitudes, on which dense tropics grew. The place forgotten by the gods, untouched by man. Perhaps, even wild animals live here, it depends on the size of the island. You walk neatly, without making a sound, there is a thick, heavy silence around.\n\nAn hour later, you began to orientate a little on the terrain. The shore you were thrown to was evidently on the eastern side of the island, the impenetrable jungle began in the west. To the south was a cold cool stream, you drank plenty and realized that you had never tasted such delicious and pure water. To the north of the bunker, you saw a hill, it's hard to call it a mountain, rather a tall stony hill, partly overgrown with jungle. There you decided to head for your next sortie, because it was time to go back and enter the code.\n\nI wonder why this code is needed? All the time, when the timer is coming to an end, the ground under your feet seems to be a little shaking ..although, probably, it just seems to you.>";

Henceforth, I would not advise you to depart from the bunker so far. And better sit there and do not stick out, otherwise we all end. It is always there and is watching us! Barely I managed to hide in the cave, next time can not be lucky. Since we are still alive, that means you figured out the computer. Probably you have many questions.

It turned out that your colleagues threw you out like an extra ballast that prevented them from gaining altitude. Not the most pleasant discovery. So you two on this island, there are no more people.\n\nIt was noticeable that Desmond was hurrying somewhere, he was hastily trying to end the conversation and all the time he was looking towards the beach. After we talked, he wished me luck again and, without looking back, moved there.\n\nYou heard a crash. Turning to the sound, you saw how in eight hundred meters from you the trees bent in different directions, almost to the ground. Something was rapidly approaching from the south.\n\nYou shouted to Desmond. He did not hear anything and went on to the beach.

I did not think that I would have to explain this, at least not so soon, but there seems to be no other way out. It's time to tell you your story.\n\nI worked in an organization that was engaged in research in the field of electromagnetic fields of the Earth. At the station where you happened to visit, there was one of the main objects of study - a crack in the earth's crust, which radiated tremendous energy. My companion followed it, conducted experiments and gradually this crack increased, and we penetrated deeper and deeper. We did not expect that the consequences could be so fatal..\n\nThere was an accident after which very few survived on this island. It's strange that I survived. I was in the epicenter of the accident and a few weeks later I still could not come to my senses. The others walled in the crack and put a computer there that somehow sheds energy once every 108 minutes. And then left me here alone ..\n\n<To be continued>";

They found me demented after the accident and left me in the bunker to monitor the computer. I regularly entered the code every 108 minutes. All that I remember before everyone escaped - one of them brought me water from the creek that flows in this cave. I drank and fainted. When I came to, there was no one else. After that, I finally lost faith in people.\n\nI learned a lot about the island in the time that I'm here. And it's incredible, believe me. The accident happened for a reason. And you and I were on this island, not by a coincidence. At first I did not believe it, but when I saw how your team throws off you, everything fell into place at once. You are the chosen one.

At first I noticed that I had passed all the diseases, after some time the primary human needs disappeared. I realized that the island made me a different person.\n\nIt seems to me that the island wants me to protect it from the outside world, and protect the outside world from black smoke. Smoke more than once suggested that I leave this place with him, apparently he can not exist without me. But I know that the world will come to an end, if it happens. Perhaps the electromagnetic field holds us back and does not allow us to leave the island. I would have known how tired I was here!\n\nIn a moment of desperation, I saw you being thrown off the balloon. I think that this happened at my request. I dreamed of a successor.
