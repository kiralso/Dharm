# Dharm

Dharm - is a text quest with an alternative story based on LOST TV series. 
Enter the code to save the world every 108 minutes, get points, and you will open new chapters of the story, where you have to make decisions and experience everything together with the characters.
Feel like you are in a laboratory where there is no distinction between a scientist and a test subject. The fate of the world is in your hands now - enter a code, but remember - exactly in 108 minutes the planet will be waiting for its savior again!
